About
---
These are basic implementations of classic cryptography algorithms, written by C. 

Classic AES ARC4 BASE64 BLOWFISH DES MDx(2/5) ROT-13 SHA(1/256) algorithm are implemented.

All of the algorithms are not optimized. you can issue the optimized code to this repository.

Using
---
The header are in the lib dictionary, the source files are in the src dictionary. 

To use it, just compile the C files which have included the H files.
